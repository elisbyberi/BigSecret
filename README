To start working with BigSecret library:
	1 - Install HBase. Current version of BigSecret was written on top of HBase 0.94.1.
	2 - If you want to use bucketizers in your data storage, then:
		a - Run Bucketizer/src/edu/utdallas/bigsecret/app/CreateBuckets. You may create as many 
			bucketizers as you need. Remember the id's that you give to the bucketizers. 
			A sample code for creating bucketizers through Java is present in 
			Proxy/src/edu/utdallas/bigsecret/proxy/test/TestProxyMode1.java
	3 - Place bucketizer.jar, cipher.jar, proxy.jar, utilities.jar to your class path. You also 
		need to have HBase related jars in your class path.
	4 - You're all set. Now you can start using BigSecret library. 
		You can find example implementations in 
		Proxy/src/edu/utdallas/bigsecret/proxy/test/TestProxyMode(1|2|3).java
